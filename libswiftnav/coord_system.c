 * Conversion from Cartesian to geodetic coordinates is a much harder problem

 *
 * Here we implement a relatively new algorithm due to Fukushima (2006) that is

 * calls during iteration and very few divisions. It also exhibits cubic
 * convergence rates compared to the quadratic rate of convergence seen with
 * the more common algortihms based on the Newton-Raphson method.
